Once upon a time.. There was a little tiny cloud callod Schmoobi. It was a very young cloud, pherhaps the size of a cherry tree. Schmoobi had never in its life rained yet, and it was excited every day and waited impatiently for the rain season to come. Every day the little cloud asked the sun " Can I rain now?". But the answer was always the same. "No, schmoobi" said the sun miltly. "Not yet, you'll have to wait until you're big engouh". So every time Schmoobi came across just a little bit of water - a half empty bottle or so - it sucked it up eagerly, and grew a little bit with each sip. But even though it grew a little every day, the sun would say the same. "schmoobi you ar still too little. Just be patient and wait." But Schmoobi couldn't wait; it wanted to grow big sooner so it could finally finally rain. One night, when the sun was busy shining for away, schmoobi made a plan: it would simply go away to a place whete there was more water to be soaked up faster and then it tould roin secretly and alono far awy from the watchful eyes of the sun. 

That same nightthe little cloud started its journey. It travelled all the way from africa to europe, Berlin be exact. And just when it was joyfully sucking up some water from the se Spree, the stars started mumbling. 

"Isn't this little schmoobi from the Sahara? Does the sum know she's here?" "She is way too little to be alone in Berlin!". And so when the sun came back, the stars did as thy always do: they told it what had happend during the night. The Sun thanked its little spies and went to find schmoobi; who had grown just a little bigger over night. Perhaps the size of a little hous. 

"Schmoobi", it said when it recognized her. "What are you doing here?". The little cloud lowered its eyes shamefully. "You are coming with me, home to the Sahara", the sun said finally, and schmoobi followed grumpily.
